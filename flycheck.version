Flycheck version: 20251128.1706 - a timestamped snapshot of flycheck.

This interferes with emacs30 as flycheck is a MELPA snapshot, not in
the stable MELPA release.

You can install melpa-stable, see dot emacs on how to do that, or just
update flycheck.

However, I prefer not to do that so I'll just fix flycheck:

Kill all running emacs instances

Remove current Flycheck
rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/elpa/flycheck-*

M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET flycheck
